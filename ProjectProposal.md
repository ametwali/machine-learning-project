# Project proposal for *ENSF 611 Project on using Machine Learning for the Titanic Disaster*
Author: *Ayah Metwali*

## 1. Why: Question/Topic being investigated 1pt

I wanted to further understand my knowledge of machine learning entering the program
so when I saw on the Kaggle site that there is one for the Titanic for beginners I thought
this would be a good practice.

## 2. How: Plan of attack 1pt

Kaggle gives guidelines on how to approach their Titanic problem. So from following that
I will make a notebook and show the predictions with different models along side their approach
recommendations.

## 3. What: Dataset, models, framework, components 2pts
Datasets are from the website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data. Models
will be LogisticRegression, RandomForest, GradientBoosting, and SVC. 
Possibility to explore XGBoost library as an alternate classifier if time permits.
